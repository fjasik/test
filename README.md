# Test

## 0. General cyber security

If you were part of a red team tasked with breaking into some small company that has zero interest in cyber security, how would you approach the subject?

## 1. JS/TS 

Look at the file `test.ts` in `./js/`.

This looks pretty vanilla. Are there any problems with this code? If there are, propose a refactor / fix / change. Any improvements?

## 2. C++ Scope Exit

Now look at the file `test.cpp` in `./Test/`.

The `EstablishWebsocketConnection` function was taken from a larger `AsyncWebsocket` class, from a side project. It is a fairly correct partial implementation of the WinHttp websocket. The flow is dictated by Microsoft, we have to create a session, open a connection and make a request, all of which create resources that we have to manually manage. Because of early returns, the function ends up repeating the code responsible for closing the handles weâ€™ve opened. What improvement could you suggest? Anything else?

## 3. Classic

What's a buffer overflow?
